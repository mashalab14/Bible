Moods (user-facing options)

Keep it around 5–6. That’s the upper limit before it feels like a quiz.
	1.	Anxious / stressed
	2.	Sad / heavy-hearted
	3.	Neutral / unsure
	4.	Hopeful / reflective
	5.	Grateful / joyful
	6.	(Optional) Tired / drained — shows up often enough to matter

Tones (your response layer)

These are behind the scenes, mapped from moods. 4–5 tones is plenty:
	1.	Calm / steady (for anxious, tired)
	2.	Compassionate / gentle (for sad, heavy-hearted)
	3.	Balanced / open (for neutral, unsure)
	4.	Uplifting / warm (for grateful, joyful)
	5.	Invitational / thoughtful (for hopeful, reflective)
