You don’t need a committee of angels picking backgrounds. You need a tiny theme engine with rules. No AI calls, no designers on standby, no “oops it’s raining so the app is depressing.” Here’s the dead-simple setup.

What picks the background?

A rule-based Theme Selector that uses 4 inputs, in order of priority:
	1.	User preference (if they picked a favorite pack, honor it)
	2.	Time of day (dawn, day, dusk, night)
	3.	Weather (clear, clouds, rain, snow) when permission available
	4.	Mood (anxious, grateful, tired…) as a gentle tint

No AI. Just a lookup table.

⸻

The assets (keep it cheap)
	•	Use procedural gradients (code-generated), not heavy photos.
	•	Add a light noise/texture overlay for depth (one tiny PNG reused).
	•	Optional: a few Lottie animations (sub-100KB) for “rain micro-dots,” “snow sparkles,” “sun shimmer.”

You now have infinite backgrounds with ~0 storage bloat.

The mapping (the brain)

Create a small table of palettes keyed by daypart + weather, with a mood tint overlay. Example:

Key	Base Gradient (start → end)	Weather Overlay	Mood Tint (alpha 8–16%)
dawn+clear	#FAD6A5 → #FFECD2	subtle lens flare	grateful: #FFD166, anxious: #6EC1E4, tired: #8C9EFF
day+clear	#AEE1F9 → #FFF6E5	soft sun shimmer	same tints
day+cloud	#D7E3F4 → #F3F6FB	cloud drift	same tints
day+rain	#B6C6D8 → #E1E8EF	fine rain dots	same tints
dusk+clear	#F9A1BC → #6C63FF	glow haze	same tints
night+clear	#1B2A49 → #274690	star sparkle	same tints
night+cloud	#212833 → #2E3847	none	same tints
night+rain	#24313C → #3A4856	rain dots	same tints
snow(any)	#EAF3FA → #FFFFFF	snow sparkle	same tints

If weather isn’t available, ignore that column and just use daypart.

Selection logic (pseudo)

function pickTheme({userPack, localTime, weather, mood}) {
  if (userPack) return userPack.pick(localTime); // user > all

  const daypart = getDaypart(localTime); // dawn/day/dusk/night
  const wx = weather?.status ?? 'none';  // clear/cloud/rain/snow/none

  // 1) choose base by daypart + wx (fallback to daypart if none)
  const base = palettes[`${daypart}+${wx}`] ?? palettes[`${daypart}+clear`];

  // 2) apply subtle mood tint (alpha 8–16%)
  const tinted = applyMoodTint(base, moodTint[mood] ?? moodTint.neutral);

  // 3) ensure contrast for text/icons (raise or lower luminance)
  return adjustForContrast(tinted, targetWCAG=4.5);
}

Every 4 hours (or on app open) you rerun this. Smoothly cross-fade 300–500 ms so it feels intentional, not jumpy.

⸻

Weather without pain
	•	If permission granted: query once on open, cache for 2–3 hours.
	•	If denied: skip weather entirely; your daypart palettes already look great.
	•	Don’t hard-depend on weather APIs; treat them as a nice-to-have.

⸻

Avoid ugly combos
	•	Clamp saturation at night so neon doesn’t blind users.
	•	If “anxious” mood + “rain” + “night” would be too gloomy, cap mood tint at 8% and switch overlay to a calm haze instead of rain.
	•	Keep a “serene failsafe” palette if contrast checks fail.

⸻

Accessibility and legibility
	•	Always run a WCAG contrast check between foreground (verse text, buttons) and final background; auto-nudge brightness to meet 4.5:1.
	•	Offer a High-Contrast toggle in settings.
	•	Respect system dark mode by biasing toward dusk/night palettes.

⸻

Who “selects” in practice?
	•	You define ~8–12 palettes once.
	•	The Theme Selector picks at runtime using rules, no API calls needed.
	•	Users can override with a favorite pack (because some people really love pink sunsets).

⸻

Caching and performance
	•	Procedural gradients render instantly; the only asset is a tiny texture PNG and optional Lottie JSON files.
	•	Keep the last chosen theme in local storage; if the app opens offline, use it and cross-fade to the new one once context is known.

⸻

Minimal to build, maximal “ahhh”
	•	10 palettes, 4 dayparts, 4 weather states, 6 mood tints.
	•	One function chooses, one function ensures contrast, one cross-fade.
	•	Zero designers on call. Zero AI calls. Zero sad rainy screens at noon unless the user likes sad rainy screens.

There. Backgrounds feel smart and “personal,” cost you basically nothing, and won’t shove a storm cloud in someone’s face at lunchtime.
