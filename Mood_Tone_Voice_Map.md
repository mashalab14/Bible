# Mood-to-Tone Voice Map

Here’s a straightforward map you can actually hand over to your writers.  
The scripture stays the same; what flexes is the *voice around it*.

| Mood                 | Tone (how it should feel)          | Voice Style (how you speak to user)                | Sample Reflection Frame                                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Anxious / Stressed** | Steady, calm, reassuring           | Short, grounding, avoids hype                      | “You may feel unsettled. This verse offers peace you can rest in.”        |
| **Sad / Heavy-hearted** | Gentle, compassionate              | Soft, validating, present with them                | “It’s okay to feel low. These words remind us hope is still near.”        |
| **Neutral / Unsure** | Balanced, open, steady             | Neutral but caring, gives space                    | “Wherever your heart is today, let this verse guide your next step.”      |
| **Grateful / Joyful** | Warm, light, uplifting             | Affirming, celebratory (without noise)             | “Thank you for pausing with gratitude. This verse shines with joy.”       |
| **Hopeful / Reflective** | Thoughtful, invitational          | Calmly leaning forward, gentle encouragement       | “Hope is growing in you. This verse invites you deeper into that light.”  |
